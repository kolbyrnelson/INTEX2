        "description": "WARNING GRAPHIC IMAGES   Rosie a beautiful loyal Poodle mix was hit by a car and was dragged 5-7 feet- her family witnessed everything that was happening to Rosie. She suffered serious injuries such as having her right arm ripped open to the bone from underarm to wrist, severe contusions to her neck and back; the impact caused Rosie's ear to be torn off which exposed the cartilage. Her family immediately picked her up and sought help, they took her to a place where they thought would help her; they took her to the Downey Shelter believing that the shelter would help keep Rosie alive. That was the furthest from reality. Luckily, for the family Lisa Corona saw the family and asked if Rosie was sick, once Lisa saw Rosie she knew that Rosie needed help-the shelter was not going to help Rosie but kill her once they convinced the family to surrender her.   Rosie is now at Dr. Werber's office receiving the care she needs to recover from her injuries, she had surgery on Wednesday to re-attach her ear to her skull   she is having surgery again today to do a \"debridement\" on her right leg to completely clean the bone area   scrape off the necrotic skin   tissue from her ligaments. Rosie is going to need long term bandage changes while her right arm is allowed to grow new skin (think of very bad burns on a human)   they will continue the cleaning process to scrape the dead tissue every few days for a few months until she is completely healed.  Please donate any amount you can, funds will be directly given to Dr. Werber for saving Rosie's life.  Thank you for your generosity and love for Rosie and her family.",

        "description": "Erik, at 13 yrs. the oldest of 3 children was diagnosed with Steven Johnsons Syndrome/TEN in February 8, 2013 (Originally misdiagnosed on 2/5/13) He had a severe allergic reaction to Azithromycin or Ibuprofen (there is no test to administer to verify which medication it was). He was hospitalized for 1 month - in which he spent 3 weeks in the ICU. Erik was Treated as a burn victim and had several eye procedures done while in the ICU. He lost 70% of his skin. He has currently been diagnosed with the \"vanishing bile duct syndrome\". This is a very rare condition... none of the doctors we have seen have seen this in any patient before. So, he will be placed on the transplant list in hopes of a new liver. Aside from his liver, he developed scars in his eye lids. Which will require more surgeries.  Knowing that there is NO chance of a full recovery our hopes are that we can help him with any current and future medical needs.  So, please if you are able to donate anything - It would mean so much to him/us. If you can't we understand. However, We would ask that you please say a prayer for him and share this page...   THANK YOU so much for taking the time to read this. Thank you for any donations and specially for ALL YOUR PRAYERS!! GOD BLESS YOU ALL!!   *********   Erik, a los 13 años. El mayor de 3 hijos se le diagnosticó síndrome de Steven Johnson/TEN en Febrero 8, 2013 (originalmente diagnosticado en 2/5/ 13) había una reacción alérgica severa a la azitromicina o ibuprofeno (no existe una prueba para verificar cual fue).  El fue hospitalizado por un período de 1 mes - en el que, durante 3 semanas fueron en la UCI. Erik fue tratado como una víctima de quemadura y tuvo varios procedimientos en los ojos durante este tiempo. Perdió 70% de su piel. Actualmente ha sido diagnosticado con \"síndrome de las vías biliares\".  Esta es una afección muy rara... ninguno de los médicos que hemos consultado han visto esto. Por lo tanto, estará en la lista de trasplante con la esperanza de un nuevo hígado. \nAparte de su hígado, Erik, desarrolló unas cicatrices en sus párpados. Lo que requerirá más cirugías. \nSabiendo que no hay posibilidad de una recuperación completa. Nuestra esperanza es de que lo podamos ayudar con sus actuales y futuras necesidades médicas. \n \nPor lo tanto, por favor, si usted es capaz de donar hoy, significaría mucho para él. Si no lo comprendemos. Sin embargo, le pedimos que por favor, diga una oración por él y comparta esta página... \n \nMUCHAS GRACIAS por tomarse el tiempo de leer esto. Gracias por todas las donaciones y especialmente para TODAS SUS ORACIONES!",

He has started his first of 6-8 rounds of aggressive chemotherapy, and unfortunately the bills are starting to pile up.  We were not prepared and are still waiting for his LTD to be processed.  In the meantime, we are expected to pay not only the household bills, but are hit with having to pay his insurance and medical expenses in order to continue treatment.  We have reduced the bills, including giving up my car (loan and insurance costs) but the medical costs are coming in.  The goal above covers his out of pocket expenses so far, insurance costs, and what we anticipate still to come from surgeon and hospital.  We know everyone has their own problems, but if you can help with a few dollars, we would greatly appreciate anything to help this battle, and allow Reggie to focus solely on his recovery, and not the stress of finances.  Reggie is a proud man, and hates to ask for anything from anyone, so I took it upon myself to create this page and ask for help.  We appreciate all the amazing support from everyone, keep those prayers coming.",

Out of pocket expenses ($9,000 per year for a family) are going to be more than I can handle on top of all of our families current medical bills that are still in the tousands.  Thank you so much for any help you can provide.  I really do appreciate you all.",

No amount of money in the world could heal the stinging pain of losing a person so precious.  However, to help the Anders deal with the loss of their son, brother, grandson, cousin, and uncle we have opened this donation page. The money raised will be used to help defer the funeral costs and a portion will be passed along to Daniel's dearest passion: Hylton Choir. We made the goal amount $7,300 because he was born on July 3, 1997 and we couldn't put a dollar amount on this devastating time. We thank you all so much for your priceless love, support, and prayers.",
